# Jinx help

## The two panes

Typically, the window of Jinx will be divided into two panes: the **viewer pane** which displays a portion of the currently selected locus and the **data pane** which displays various relevant information – by default, a table with all features that are currently visible in the viewer pane. The currently focused pane is highlighted with a green border and one can switch focus between elements with the `Tab ↹` key.
